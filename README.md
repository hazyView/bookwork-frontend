## 🧪 Mock Data & Development

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: This application runs **ENTIRELY on mock data**. No real API integration exists.

- **User Profiles** - Hardcoded sample member and author accounts
- **Book Clubs** - Static mock club data with fake member rosters
- **Events** - Simulated calendar events with mock attendance data
- **Books** - Static book catalog for demonstration only
- **Analytics** - Fake performance metrics and insights

All mock data is defined in `src/lib/mockData.js` and `src/lib/api.js`. The application automatically serves mock data in development mode and will fail in production without proper API integration.

## 🚨 Missing Critical Components

### Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: Vitest framework with comprehensive validation tests
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing configured
- ✅ **E2E Tests**: Playwright for cross-browser end-to-end testing
- ✅ **Security Tests**: XSS prevention, CSP validation, security headers
- ✅ **Performance Tests**: Bundle size monitoring, load time testing
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: Code coverage reporting with V8 provider

**Testing Commands**:
```bash
npm run test              # Run unit tests
npm run test:watch        # Watch mode for development
npm run test:coverage     # Generate coverage report
npm run test:e2e          # Run E2E tests
npm run test:all          # Run all tests
```

### Production Readiness
- ✅ **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, XSS protection implemented
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Comprehensive client-side validation and sanitization
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Basic rate limiting for form submissions and API calls
- ✅ **Performance Optimization**: Caching, lazy loading, bundle optimization
- ❌ **Environment Configuration**: Production environment variables needed
- ❌ **Monitoring**: Error tracking and analytics integration required
- ❌ **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipeline needed

### Backend Integration
- **API Endpoints**: No real API connections implemented
- **Authentication**: Mock authentication only
- **Data Validation**: No server-side validation
- **Error Handling**: Limited production error handling

## ⚙️ Technical Debt

1. **~~Mixed Adapter Configuration~~**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Now using adapter-node for Docker
2. **~~Missing Security Headers~~**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Comprehensive security headers implemented  
3. **~~No Input Validation~~**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Client-side validation with sanitization
4. **~~No Testing Framework~~**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Vitest + Playwright testing suite
5. **Hardcoded API URLs**: No dynamic environment-based API configuration  
6. **Mock Data Coupling**: Mock data tightly coupled to components
7. **Missing Type Safety**: Limited TypeScript coverage in API layer

## 🌐 Deployment

> **⚠️ WARNING**: This application is NOT production-ready. Deployment will fail without proper backend API integration.

### Current Build Process
```bash
npm run build  # Creates demo build with mock data
```

### Required for Production
1. **Backend API**: Implement real API endpoints
2. **Environment Variables**: Configure production environment
3. **Authentication Service**: Replace mock authentication
4. **Database Integration**: Replace mock data with real data
5. **Security Configuration**: Implement proper security headers
6. **Testing Suite**: Add comprehensive test coverage
7. **Monitoring**: Add error tracking and performance monitoring

### Deployment Platforms (After Production Setup)
- **Vercel**: Serverless functions + static files (with API backend)
- **Netlify**: Edge functions + static hosting (with API backend)
- **Node.js**: Server deployment (requires adapter-node configuration)
