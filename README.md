## 🧪 Mock Data & Development

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: This application runs **ENTIRELY on mock data**. No real API integration exists.

- **User Profiles** - Hardcoded sample member and author accounts
- **Book Clubs** - Static mock club data with fake member rosters
- **Events** - Simulated calendar events with mock attendance data
- **Books** - Static book catalog for demonstration only
- **Analytics** - Fake performance metrics and insights

All mock data is defined in `src/lib/mockData.js` and `src/lib/api.js`. The application automatically serves mock data in development mode and will fail in production without proper API integration.

## 🚨 Missing Critical Components

### Testing Infrastructure
- **No Unit Tests**: No testing framework configured
- **No Integration Tests**: Component interactions untested  
- **No E2E Tests**: User workflows not validated
- **No Test Coverage**: Code coverage unknown

**Recommendation**: Implement Vitest + @testing-library/svelte + Playwright

### Production Readiness
- **Environment Configuration**: No production environment variables
- **Security Headers**: Missing security configurations
- **Performance Optimization**: No caching or optimization strategies
- **Monitoring**: No error tracking or analytics
- **CI/CD**: No automated testing or deployment

### Backend Integration
- **API Endpoints**: No real API connections implemented
- **Authentication**: Mock authentication only
- **Data Validation**: No server-side validation
- **Error Handling**: Limited production error handling

## ⚙️ Technical Debt

1. **Mixed Adapter Configuration**: Package uses adapter-auto but Docker expects adapter-node
2. **Hardcoded API URLs**: No dynamic environment-based API configuration  
3. **Mock Data Coupling**: Mock data tightly coupled to components
4. **Missing Type Safety**: Limited TypeScript coverage in API layer
5. **No Input Validation**: Client-side validation only

## 🌐 Deployment

> **⚠️ WARNING**: This application is NOT production-ready. Deployment will fail without proper backend API integration.

### Current Build Process
```bash
npm run build  # Creates demo build with mock data
```

### Required for Production
1. **Backend API**: Implement real API endpoints
2. **Environment Variables**: Configure production environment
3. **Authentication Service**: Replace mock authentication
4. **Database Integration**: Replace mock data with real data
5. **Security Configuration**: Implement proper security headers
6. **Testing Suite**: Add comprehensive test coverage
7. **Monitoring**: Add error tracking and performance monitoring

### Deployment Platforms (After Production Setup)
- **Vercel**: Serverless functions + static files (with API backend)
- **Netlify**: Edge functions + static hosting (with API backend)
- **Node.js**: Server deployment (requires adapter-node configuration)
